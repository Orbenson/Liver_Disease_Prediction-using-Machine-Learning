Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Liver Patient Records dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains records from 416 liver disease patients and 167 non-liver disease patients. The dataset includes various clinical and demographic features, such as age, gender, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, and more.

**Machine Learning Model**

The machine learning model used in this project is a Logistic Regression classifier. This model was chosen because it is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that can handle both binary and multi-class classification problems. The performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results**

The trained machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 0.72 on the test set. This means that the model correctly predicted the presence or absence of liver disease in 72% of the cases. The precision, recall, and F1-score of the model were also calculated and reported in the notebook.

**Conclusion**

In this project, we demonstrated how machine learning techniques can be used to predict liver disease. We trained a Logistic Regression classifier on a dataset of liver disease patients and non-liver disease patients and evaluated its performance using various metrics. The results of our experiments show that the model achieved a moderate level of accuracy in predicting liver disease. Further work can be done to improve the performance of the model, such as using more sophisticated machine learning algorithms or incorporating additional features into the dataset.
