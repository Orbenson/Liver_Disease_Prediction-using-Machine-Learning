**Project Name**
Liver Disease Prediction using PySpark

Description
This project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease based on various medical features, such as age, gender, total bilirubin level, etc. The prediction is done using machine learning algorithms implemented with PySpark, a Python library for distributed computing.

Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

PySpark 3.0 or later (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
Scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Indian Liver Patient Records (ILPD) dataset, which can be found at the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records

The dataset contains 583 samples, each with 10 features, and a binary label indicating whether the patient has liver disease or not.

Usage
Clone the project repository.
Download the ILPD dataset and extract it into the project directory.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the LiverDiseasePrediction.py file using the following command:
bash
Copy code
spark-submit LiverDiseasePrediction.py
The program will read the dataset, preprocess it, train the machine learning models, and output the evaluation metrics for each model.
